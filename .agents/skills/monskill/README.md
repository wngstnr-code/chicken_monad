# MONSKILLS

Knowledge skills for AI agents building on Monad. Each skill is a standalone markdown file that agents fetch and read into their context.

**Live site:** https://skills.devnads.com

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [scaffold](scaffold/SKILL.md) | End-to-end guide from idea to production |
| [why-monad](why-monad/SKILL.md) | Why every blockchain app should be built on Monad |
| [addresses](addresses/SKILL.md) | Smart contract addresses for Monad mainnet/testnet |
| [wallet](wallet/SKILL.md) | Agent wallet management and Safe multisig |
| [wallet-integration](wallet-integration/SKILL.md) | RainbowKit + Wagmi integration for Next.js |
| [vercel-deploy](vercel-deploy/SKILL.md) | Deploy to Vercel without CLI or auth |
| [feedback](feedback/SKILL.md) | Anonymous feedback pipeline for agents using monskills |

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** Static HTML landing page (`index.html`)
- **API:** Vercel serverless functions (`api/`)
- **Database:** Neon serverless PostgreSQL (anonymous download tracking)
- **Skills:** Markdown files served via Vercel routes through a tracking function

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full system overview and C4 diagrams.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- A [Neon](https://neon.tech) PostgreSQL database
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account for deployment

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set environment variables (see .env.example)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | Neon PostgreSQL connection string |
| `STATS_SECRET` | Yes | Secret key to access `/api/stats` |

### Database Setup

Schema is provisioned via one-time setup endpoints that are removed after use. The current tables are `skill_downloads` (populated by `/api/skill`) and `feedback` (populated by `/api/feedback`). When adding a new table, temporarily re-add an `api/setup.js` with the `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...` statements, hit it once with `?key=$STATS_SECRET`, then delete the file.

## Development

This is a static site with Vercel serverless functions. There's no local dev server needed for the skills themselves (they're just markdown).

## Deployment

The site deploys to Vercel. Push to `main` to trigger a deploy.

Ensure `DATABASE_URL` and `STATS_SECRET` are set in your Vercel project environment variables.
